    "## Task B – Definition of B2C companies\n",
    "B2C companies differentiate themselves from B2Bs mainly on the fact that transactions are made between one big player and many small players. This idiosyncrasy allows us to think about some criteria that will help us identify such companies:\n",
    "1. As B2Cs goal is to attract as many customers as possible they usually invest more in marketing. While B2Bs target their customers through a personalized attention, B2Cs usually need exposure.  One of the advantages of using such criteria is the simplicity to separate between different industries depending on our needs. There are plenty of companies that track companies’ advertising expenditures, Kantar is one of them. The availability of this information made me choose the marketing criteria for making the list of 100 B2C. One thing to consider, when using marketing lists, removing food and pharmaceutical brands is crucial for filtering only the B2Cs. These brands usually use other businesses to reach the final consumer.  \n",
    "2. Another feature that is related to the one above, is their necessity of exposure. Usually, B2Cs are located on the main floors of avenues with high transit. We can obtain the data from Google Maps.\n",
    "It is important to consider that this is useful only for brick and mortars B2Cs, while the above criteria allow us to find online businesses as well.\n",
    "3. Given the uneven relationship that exists between vendors and customers on B2C operations, most countries have a government agency that protects the consumer’s rights. From the claims records, we can obtain the names of those companies that are not giving a good service to their customers. \n",
    "In Israel, this data can be seen at consumers.org.il\n",
    "4. With the burst of online shopping many forums where consumers share their reviews have emerged. Marketplaces like Amazon are a go-to place when looking for B2Cs at a detailed level.\n",
    "5. Another criteria that differentiates between B2Cs and B2B is the average ticket size. When having access to financial statements, we can be confident that a smaller invoice size and a higher number of different sales are both indicators that we are looking at a B2C.\n",
    "6. There are some countries where the VAT is only added when a final transaction has been made. Looking at sales that generate a consumer’s tax is another way to identify B2C companies.\n",
    "Most of the business transactions are made between B2Bs, the road for producing a final product is often long, but here we have enumerated some parameters that can help us identify the companies whose operations are directed to the final consumer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the Excel file named 100B2C. for the list containing the one hundred companies that we identified as B2Cs. "
